    A class for generating text using the OpenAI GPT model.

    Attributes:
    - api_key (str): The API key used for accessing the OpenAI GPT model.

    Methods:
    - __init__(api_key): Constructor method to initialize the GPT_Text_Generator instance with the provided API key.
    - connect_to_client(): Connects to the OpenAI client using the provided API key.
    - __make_request(tone, size, n_texts, gpt_model_name): Makes a request to the OpenAI GPT model to generate text based on the provided parameters.
    - generate_paragraphs(tone, size, n_required_paragraph, gpt_model_name): Generates paragraphs of text for the specified tone, size, and number of required paragraphs using the OpenAI GPT model.
    - generate_prompt(): Generates a prompt to be used in the conversation with the GPT model.
